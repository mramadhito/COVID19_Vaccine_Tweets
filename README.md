# Analyzing Online Discourse on COVID-19 Vaccines: Evidence from Twitter
To understand the public's opinion and perceptions on COVID-19 vaccines, we utilize natural
language processing techniques on the COVID-19 All Vaccines Tweets dataset. The
procedure includes text data preprocessing, word cloud generation, time series analysis,
comparison using data visualization. The methods include sentiment analysis using the TextBlob
and VADER algorithms, word clouds, TF-IDF and time series.  We find that Western-made and mRNA
vaccines tend to induce tweets with higher positive sentiment than non-Western, non-mRNA
ones. Chinese vaccines have a slightly lower sentiment score on Twitter than non-Chinese
vaccines. Ultimately, we can prove that there are significant differences in online conversations
between different types of vaccines.
